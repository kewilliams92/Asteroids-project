Asteroids Game in Python with Pygame

Overview

This is my version of the classic Asteroids game, built from scratch using Python and Pygame. It was a fun and challenging project that helped me learn more about game development, especially how to handle movement, collisions, and object interactions. The game is straightforward but engaging, and it’s been really rewarding to see it all come together.

Features

	•	Smooth Gameplay: I made sure the game runs at a consistent 60 frames per second, so everything feels smooth and responsive.
	•	Game Over Mechanic: The game continues until the player is hit by an asteroid. When that happens, it prints “Game Over” in the console and ends the session.
	•	Organized Code: I used Pygame Groups to keep things clean and manageable. This helped a lot with updating and drawing game objects without the code getting cluttered.
	•	Player Controls: The player controls a triangle-shaped ship that can move freely using the WASD keys. It’s simple but gives you a lot of control.
	•	Dynamic Asteroids: The asteroids move randomly around the screen, so every game feels a bit different. Shooting them adds another layer of strategy:
	•	Large asteroids split into two medium ones.
	•	Medium asteroids split into two small ones.
	•	Small asteroids disappear completely when hit.
	•	Collision Detection: I implemented collision detection to handle when the player gets hit (ending the game) or when projectiles hit asteroids (splitting or destroying them).
	•	Constants for Key Values: I used constants to manage important game settings like speed, sizes, and frame rates, which made tweaking and balancing the game a lot easier.

What I Learned

This project was a great way to get hands-on experience with Pygame and game development in general. One of the biggest things I learned was how to manage object interactions, like splitting asteroids and handling collisions. Using Pygame Groups was also a game-changer—it kept my code organized and made it easier to focus on building features instead of juggling messy updates.

Overall, this was a fun project that taught me a lot, and I’m excited to keep building on it with new features and improvements. If you’re interested in the code or want to talk more about what I’ve learned, let me know—I’d love to share!
